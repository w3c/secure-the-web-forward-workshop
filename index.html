    <h2>Purpose of this workshop</h2>
    <p>The world wide web is the most pervasive development and deployment platform for applications and services. Its distributed, non-curated and amorphous nature, as well as the lack of friction, is at the same time its great differentiator and an enormous challenge, particularly in the arena of security. Security vulnerabilities in applications are a target for bad actors. When applications are deployed on the web across a heterogeneous environment of cloud providers, networks and browsers, the potential for exploitation of these vulnerabilities is increased. Insecure web applications can be a vector for malware, privacy violations, ransomware and unwanted surveillance.</p>
    <p>There has been a recent movement to more secure software development and deployment platforms. There have also been many new features and specifications added to web platform technologies to strengthen security. However these efforts are sometimes disconnected from each other, leading to a lack of clear guidance for web developers about the threats, mitigations and indeed the role web developers play in ensuring their applications are secure.</p>

    <p>Possible outcomes include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying specific work on documentation that could be useful for web developers to help them make better use of existing web security technologies;</li>
      <li>Recommending a new working group in W3C, OpenSSF or elsewhere, or a joint task force</li>
      <li>Determining what updates are needed in commonly used libraries;</li>
      <li>Describing potential new web features / new language features in commonly used programming languages;</li>
      <li>Calling for updates to commonly used web standard APIs;</li>
      <li>Planning for collaboration between web standards and open source security initiatives;</li>
      <li>Planning for producing concise guidance on security issues that is aimed at web developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is W3C?</h2>
    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all foundational Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and privacy. W3C also provides the standards that undergird the infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas such as entertainment, communications, digital publishing, and financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for free and under the groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy.</p>
<p>W3C's vision for "One Web" brings together thousands of dedicated technologists representing more than 400 member organizations and dozens of industry sectors. W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization incorporated in the United States of America, led by a Board of Directors and employing a global staff across the globe.</p>
