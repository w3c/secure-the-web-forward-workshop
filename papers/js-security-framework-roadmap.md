# Roadmap planning for a JavaScript security framework

By [Joe Sepi and Robin Ginn](#authors).

## Description

The OpenJS Foundation has a full tank of gas to build and execute a security framework roadmap for JavaScript thanks to the funding support from the [German government’s Sovereign Tech Fund](https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/). New dedicated resources combined with active OpenJS working groups in security and standards can help the JS ecosystem broadly adopt more secure policies and practices. OpenJS is seeking feedback from web platform communities in developing a security and maintenance roadmap plan.

Joe Sepi, OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC) Chair, and Chair of the OpenJS Security Collaboration Space, together with OpenJS Executive Director Robin Ginn, seek an interactive discussion about industry best practices and priorities so that OpenJS can help customize and execute for JavaScript.

Best practices from OpenSSF and OWASP, for example:
* Concise Guides for both consumers and developers:
  * [OpenSSF best practices for evaluating OSS software](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.md#readme)
  * [OpenSSF best practices for developing more secure software](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Concise-Guide-for-Developing-More-Secure-Software.md#readme)
  * [OpenSSF best practices guide focused on dependency management & supply chain security](https://openssf.org/blog/2022/09/01/npm-best-practices-for-the-supply-chain/)
* OpenSSF Best Practices Badge program.
* Policies and practices for secure releases and CVE management.
  * Secure signage for releases (eg Sigstore, GPG)
  * Secure SBOMs against ENISA, NTIA and CISA requirements

The OpenJS Foundation is committed to supporting the healthy growth of the JavaScript ecosystem and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities for the benefit of the community at large.

The foundation’s [hosted projects](https://openjsf.org/projects/) have a significant level of maturity and stability, achieved through open and transparent technical governance, and a positive culture of cross-project collaboration among OpenJS projects through its [Cross Project Council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council) (CPC). Hosted projects include Node.js, jQuery, Jest, Electron, webpack, ESLint, Node-RED and Appium.
