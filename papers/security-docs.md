# Documentation for web security education

By [Florian Scholz](#author).

## Description

The WebDX group ran a short survey on MDN to identify the most challenging security aspects that web devs need to face today. (297 responses)

At least two aspects of this survey suggest that better education is needed:

* "Understanding security threats": 29% said "very challenging" and 40% "somewhat challenging".
* "Understanding the browser security model": 27% said "very challenging" and 39% said "somewhat challenging"

The Open Web Docs team would like to attend the Secure the Web Forward workshop to collaborate with a group of security experts on writing better documentation for web security on MDN Web Docs.

Given the survey results, and with the help of subject matter experts, we want to produce a content outline to improve the information web developers need to understand web security.

To achieve this we want to use Divioâ€™s documentation system to make the docs better. It requires four different types of documentation to be created: Tutorials (learning-oriented), How-Tos (problem-oriented), Guides (understanding-oriented), Reference (information-oriented).

Currently, on MDN, web security is documented on the Web/Security page with a few subpages. We would like to bring structure into this documentation area and fill gaps.
