# Software Bill of Materials for web frontends

By [Jan Kowalleck](#author).

## Description

Today's web frontends are more and more assembled from multiple components from different sources. Assembler tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) are used to bundle deliverables for the web. Even Angular and React use webpack for this purpose.
For multiple roles, it appears important to know accurate details of this assembly and deliverables.

## Solution

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a way to describe components, assembly, and formulation of software, such as web deliverables. Such SBOMs can be ingested into dependency trackers, vulnerability analyzers, or risk assessment tools.

SBOM can document the state of the software they deliver to clients' web browsers. SBOM can document the licensing situation of a web frontend. SBOM can help understand supply chain risks.

For all the use cases, it is very important to create an *accurate* SBOM based on what is actually delivered.

### Retrieval of SBOM

Retrieving the SBOM of a web frontend is discussed in an [IETF draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access).

Unfortunately, this is still a draft. It would really help if this was on a more mature level, a standard at best.

### Generation of SBOM

One document standard for SBOM is OWASP's [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), which is capable of documenting an application's metadata, components, dependencies, licensing, and formulation.

OWASP's [CycloneDX Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin) is a tool that hooks into webpack to create a CycloneDX SBOM containing an aggregate of all bundled dependencies. This plugin uses the linkages generated by webpack to create a dependency graph that only contains the dependencies that are actually used (after tree-shaking) in the bundled result. To my knowledge, OWASP's CycloneDX Webpack Plugin is the only tool that creates an *accurate* SBOM based on what is actually delivered.
