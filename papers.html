          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Today's web frontends are more and more assembled from multiple components from different sources. Assembler tools like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> are used to bundle deliverables for the web. Even Angular and React use webpack for this purpose.
          For multiple roles, it appears important to know accurate details of this assembly and deliverables.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="sbom-web-solution">
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a way to describe components, assembly, and formulation of software, such as web deliverables. Such SBOMs can be ingested into dependency trackers, vulnerability analyzers, or risk assessment tools.</p>
          <p>SBOM can document the state of the software they deliver to clients' web browsers. SBOM can document the licensing situation of a web frontend. SBOM can help understand supply chain risks.</p>
          <p>For all the use cases, it is very important to create an <em>accurate</em> SBOM based on what is actually delivered.</p>
          <h6>Retrieval of SBOM</h6>
          <p>Retrieving the SBOM of a web frontend is discussed in an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access">IETF draft</a>.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this is still a draft. It would really help if this was on a more mature level, a standard at best.</p>
          <h6>Generation of SBOM</h6>
          <p>One document standard for SBOM is OWASP's <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, which is capable of documenting an application's metadata, components, dependencies, licensing, and formulation.</p>
          <p>OWASP's <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin">CycloneDX Webpack Plugin</a> is a tool that hooks into webpack to create a CycloneDX SBOM containing an aggregate of all bundled dependencies. This plugin uses the linkages generated by webpack to create a dependency graph that only contains the dependencies that are actually used (after tree-shaking) in the bundled result. To my knowledge, OWASP's CycloneDX Webpack Plugin is the only tool that creates an <em>accurate</em> SBOM based on what is actually delivered.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Establishing a common vocabulary and protocol for accessing SBOM information over the public internet would ease integration into various software build and deployment systems thereby improving overall software supply chain security.</p>
          <p>Although this is a very ambitious goal, there is already a lot of standardization we can leverage for this purpose.</p>
          <p>There is an existing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access">IETF draft proposal</a> to extend the Manufacturers Usage Description (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8520">RFC 8520</a>) to discover and retrieve SBOM information. Although this proposal is focused on devices at the end of the supply chain, aspects of the model and approach could be leveraged for more general SBOM discovery scenarios.</p>
          <p>For the SBOM vocabulary, the SPDX standard defines terms for supporting use cases involving SBOMs as well as many other supply chain relevant use cases.</p>
          <p>The SPDX standard is a formal ISO standard (<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html">ISO/IEC 5962:2021</a>) as well as an <a href="https://spdx.org/rdf/terms/">RDF ontology</a> described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">W3C OWL Ontology language</a>. The standard is also freely available as a <a href="https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/blob/master/schemas/spdx-schema.json">JSON schema</a> and more <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/">human readable web pages</a>.</p>
          <p>SPDX is supported and maintained by a large group of contributors representing tooling providers, SBOM producers and SBOM consumers.</p>
          <p>The upcoming SPDX 3.0 has some very specific enhancements for making the SBOM information more web accessible.</p>
          <p>Leveraging an existing well-defined vocabulary that supports standards ranging from JSON Schemas to full RDF Ontologies can accelerate the adoption of internet accessible SBOM data and improve overall software supply chain security.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>
            Today, whenever you open a web app, the browser fetches and runs its
            source code from the server. This enables the ease of deployment and
            iteration that the web is known for, but can also pose security risks.
            In particular, for web apps that don't want to trust the server, such
            as those using client-side encryption to protect the user's data before
            sending it to the server, or those processing the user's data entirely
            client-side without sending any sensitive data to the server, the
            current security model of the web is insufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, if a web app claims not to send sensitive data to the
            server, this is very difficult for users to check, as they would need to read
            (and understand) the source every time it's loaded from the server.
            Even for security researchers, such a claim is impossible to verify, as
            the server could simply serve a different version of the web app to a
            user it wants to target than to the security researcher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, we would like to propose a mechanism to enable security
            researchers to audit the source code of especially-sensitive web apps
            that is (or was) sent to any user, not just to themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is only to allow detection rather than prevention of malicious
            code, possibly after the fact, as we believe this will still deter
            servers from serving malicious code. Additionally, preventing malicious
            code from being deployed would require mandating security audits prior
            to deploys, which would slow down and fundamentally change the
            deployment model of the web.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="source-code-transparency-proposal">
          <h5>High-level Proposal</h5>
          <p>
            To accomplish the above, the source code of (a given version of) a web
            app should be published to a transparency log, similar to <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">Certificate Transparency</a>. Then, when opening
            a web app, the browser should check that the fetched source code was
            received by (and is or will be included in) the transparency log, and
            only run it if so. Then, security researchers can check the transparency
            log for all published versions of a given web app, and check that none of
            them contain any malicious code.
          </p>
          <p>
            To aid the auditing process, web apps may want to employ additional
            existing and proposed security mechanisms, such as CSP, SRI, SBOMs,
            reproducible builds, etc. These mechanisms, which currently only allow
            the developer of web apps to check the security of the web app, would
            additionally allow external security researchers to audit a web app, if
            it used a mechanism such as Source Code Transparency.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="source-code-transparency-details">
          <h5>Detailed Proposal</h5>
          <p>
            To simplify the distribution and integrity verification of web apps'
            source code, we could make use of
            <a href="https://wpack-wg.github.io/bundled-responses/draft-ietf-wpack-bundled-responses.html">Web Bundles</a>,
            and publish a hash of the bundle to a transparency log.
          </p>
          <p>
            The transparency log could be structured as an append-only chain of
            Merkle Trees, each of which operates as a map of (domain, version) keys
            to hash(bundle) values (where the key could be hashed and interpreted
            as a binary path in the binary tree, with the value of the final leaf
            being the hash of the web bundle). Web apps could submit the hash of
            the bundle to the transparency log, which would periodically include
            all (existing and new versions of each) web app in the next Merkle Tree.
            Auditors could check that the transparency log is behaving consistently
            and not changing the hash of old versions of web apps, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, when loading a participating web app, the browser would check the
            latest Merkle Tree and verify that the hash of the bundle received is
            included in it, and warn the user if not. To still allow instantaneous
            deploys, we could allow this check to be done some time after loading
            the web app, at the cost of delayed warnings in case of issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            To signal to the browser that a given web app is using Source Code
            Transparency, we could introduce a X.509 certificate extension, which
            would automatically be included in the Certificate Transparency logs,
            allowing security researchers to check that all certificates for the
            domain of the web app include this extension. Browser would refuse to
            load web apps without Source Code Transparency from a domain using a
            certificate with this extension.

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>The problem of supply chain security for the Web is currently being addressed by building up databases of known issues and improving the pace at which research and testing results are delivered to web developers. The approach has been successful in improving the security of popular open source software. The friction introduced by false-positives and its impact on security postures in the community is yet to be addressed.</p>
          <p>This approach depends on security researchers, increasingly aided by AI, discovering vulnerabilities and malicious packages. It constitutes an arms race, while the growth in malicious packages for the web ecosystem is clearly superlinear.</p>
          <p>As a result, projects wait for audit results of their dependencies to trickle down to developers, and assume malicious packages will be discovered in time for them to be stopped. Targeted attacks and sophisticated threat actors may never be stopped by this approach even at maximum throughput.</p>
          <p>We need another layer of protection that can be proactive, not reactive.</p>
          <p>Using Hardened JavaScript one can take control of all powerful APIs and resources in JavaScript and decide which should be avialable to specific dependencies. With appropriate tooling that can also include projects producing bundles where application code and dependencies coexist in one file and share references.</p>
          <p>Hardened JavaScript protects all intrinsics from being modified and introduces the <code>Compartment</code> constructor, which can be used to evaluate code in isolation from outer scope.</p>
          <p>The current approach in LavaMoat is to generate a policy at a point in time and only allow access to expected globals and imports. The enforcement happens at runtime using <code>Compartment</code>s. Any dependency suddenly turning malicious, for example by reaching for <code>fetch</code> although it was not accessing network before, will fail to work.</p>
          <p>As work on introducing Hardened Javascript (<code>Module\*</code> classes, <code>Evaluator</code>s, <code>Compartment</code> and lockdown) to JavaScript progresses, it's time to look into making runtime supply chain security a feature of the Web platform.</p>
          <p>While using <code>Compartment</code> to isolate dependencies and control what they access is a proven technique by now, open questions remain.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to DOM is the ultimate power that makes references to all globals reachable. Attempts to apply a membrane to DOM have not been successful.</li>
            <li><code>Compartment</code> can provide isolation within one Realm, but accessing another Realm would allow escalating privileges further.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I wish to present on the topic above and open a conversation about supporting the proactive approach to supply chain security in the Web platform.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <h6>Introduction</h6>
          <p>There are many security tools that try to defend web apps in runtime in the browser by redefining and protecting built in JavaScript APIs.
          The need for such tools grows with the difficulty in securing web apps supply chains which results in having a hard time detecting changes in the supply chain that might cause harm in the victim's browser.</p>
          <p>For example, if a malicious code manages to execute within the browser of the victim, it can try accessing some secrets stored by the app in the <code>localStorage</code> - therefore we have different security tools which attempt to better control access to such sensitive APIs by redefining their behaviour to be more selective on which code is allowed to access it and which code isn't.</p>
          <h6>Problem</h6>
          <p>However, thanks to JavaScript realms, an attacker can ignore such protection quite easily by simply creating a new JavaScript realm and accessing such sensitive APIs via the new realm's unique set of APIs:</p>
          <div class="highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
            <pre><span class="pl-c">// will fail if the localStorage API is hooked into by a security tool</span>
<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">stolenSecret</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">localStorage</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">secret</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
<span class="pl-c">// bypass security tool easily - access the sensitive API via a new realm</span>
<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">stolenSecret</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-smi">document</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">body</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">appendChild</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-smi">document</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">createElement</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s">'iframe'</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">contentWindow</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">localStorage</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">secret</span></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This effectively eliminates such protections almost completely.</p>
          <h6>Solution (WIP)</h6>
          <p>We are currently working on the most advanced solution to this problem by trying to provide an easy way to handle creation of new realms in runtime before attackers gain access to those.</p>
          <p>However, implementing such a solution in JS comes with many difficulties and issues, which could have been easier to address natively by the browser.</p>
          <h6>Goal</h6>
          <p>I wish to bring up this issue and the possible approaches to it in order to discuss and explore them.</p>

        <section id="cookies-desc">
          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Browser vendors' efforts to disable third-party cookies are motivated
          primarily by privacy / anti-tracking considerations, but they have a
          significant - and generally underappreciated - impact on the overall
          security of the web platform. The presence of third-party cookies is the
          root cause of multiple classes of vulnerabilities in web applications, such
          as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), clickjacking and numerous cross-site
          leaks; consequently, blocking the sending of cookies on cross-site requests
          would provide web applications with substantial isolation benefits.</p>
          <p>However, the anti-tracking focus of third-party cookie blocking efforts
          carries a risk of leading to implementations which won't reliably protect
          websites from cross-site attacks. For example, establishing the top-level
          site as the boundary for sending third-party cookies (the current
          implementation in multiple browsers) risks allowing untrusted embedded
          content, such as ads, to send credentialed requests to endpoints hosted by
          the top-level site and continue to exploit cross-site vulnerabilities.</p>
          <p>Similarly, mechanisms meant to restore functionality limited by the
          deprecation of third-party cookies, such as the
          <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-access/">Storage Access API</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/privacycg/CHIPS">Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State</a> (CHIPS),
          <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a> (FedCM),
          as well as various features to re-enable third-party cookies on a
          per-site basis, need to grapple with the same scoping rules. The risk of
          being overly permissive (for example, creating convenient mechanisms to
          fully re-enable third-party cookies for a given site) is that it will
          permit web-based attackers to bypass built-in isolation defenses. This is
          particularly concerning in the long run: if the web is safe by default from
          cross-site vulnerabilities, developers will pay less attention to
          implementing application mitigations (such as the use of CSRF tokens or
          <code>X-Frame-Options</code> headers). As a result, attackers who can regain access to
          third-party cookies on their sites will be able to exploit gaps in
          isolation on a large fraction of the web.</p>
          <p>This session is meant to discuss the cookie model that we're aiming for
          from a security perspective, including a review of the potential security
          benefits of reliable third-party cookie blocking. It also aims to identify
          specific hardening opportunities for browsers' third-party cookie blocking
          logic to help browser vendors improve their implementations.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Open source security has increasingly become a top concern due to numerous high-profile and high-impact vulnerabilities affecting critical open source projects that underpin the internet's infrastructure. Over the years, various industry efforts have aimed to address this issue, with a renewed sense of urgency emerging recently. The White House and the EU Commission have taken notice, and legislative efforts are underway across multiple jurisdictions. Open source security is now increasingly framed as a software supply chain issue.</p>
          <p>In this context, the OpenSSF has launched an ambitious new project called Alpha-Omega. Most of the open source projects identified by Alpha-Omega fit well within the activity streams defined by the OpenSSF's Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan. they are, after all, the infrastructure building blocks that this initiative was designed to harden.</p>
          <p>A few projects, however, stand out. jQuery is one of them.</p>
          <p>Originally released in 2006, jQuery has significantly impacted both web developers and browser vendors by addressing browser interoperability issues through a unified and enjoyable-to-use API. This has empowered web developers, accelerated the advent of the Web as an application platform, and driven the adoption of better Web standards and more interoperable implementations.</p>
          <p>Despite newer frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Svelte gaining popularity, jQuery remains an essential feature of the Web. As of today, it is present in a staggering 78% of the top 1 million websites, according to BuiltWith. For context, React is only found on 14% of the same sample, and most other JavaScript libraries that appeared in the meantime (e.g., Twitter Bootstrap, Modernizr, or Backbone) have fallen out of favor.</p>
          <p>jQuery's massive reach and longevity aren't its only unique aspects. It's also one of the rare JavaScript libraries identified by Alpha-Omega that is directly consumer-facing--effectively running on billions of consumer devices--and it runs inside the browser sandbox. This combination creates a different set of security concerns and calls for a dedicated approach.</p>
          <p>While this approach is specific to jQuery in this context, it touches on several broader points relevant to this audience, notably:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identifying vulnerabilities that are specific to JavaScript code that is meant to be run in the browser sandbox.</li>
            <li>Educating maintainers of web-facing open source projects about those vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Improving web developer education about browser and web application security to reduce the prevalence of those vulnerabilities that the browser sandbox cannot protect from.</li>
            <li>Supporting standardization efforts designed to reduce related risk (particularly around making it easier to manage user-generated content more safely).</li>
            <li>Exploring the life cycle of open-source projects, in particular those that fill browser standardization gaps ot interoperability issues.</li>
            <li>Examining the security aspects of hosting JavaScript on CDNs and determining best practices around those (and a possible deprecation path).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This project also provides an opportunity to explore improving the security of end-users on the web through multi-modal approaches across:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>standard bodies and standardization efforts</li>
            <li>browser implementations and developer tools</li>
            <li>developers advocates</li>
            <li>documentation (such as MDN)</li>
            <li>specialized media</li>
            <li>maintainers of open source libraries and the foundations that support them</li>
            <li>industry-wide security-focused efforts such as Alpha-Omega project</li>
            <li>open source funding through both industry and national efforts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once again--and against all odds--jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.</p>
