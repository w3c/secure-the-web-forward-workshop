          <p>The WebDX community group ran a short survey on MDN to <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/blob/main/mdn-short-surveys/2023-05-15-security-dx/interpretation.md">identify the most challenging security aspects that web devs need to face today</a>. (297 responses)</p>
          <p>At least two aspects of this survey suggest that better education is needed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Understanding security threats": 29% said "very challenging" and 40% "somewhat challenging".</li>
            <li>"Understanding the browser security model": 27% said "very challenging" and 39% said "somewhat challenging"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Open Web Docs team would like to attend the Secure the Web Forward workshop to collaborate with a group of security experts on writing better documentation for web security on MDN Web Docs.</p>
          <p>Given the survey results, and with the help of subject matter experts, we want to produce a content outline to improve the information web developers need to understand web security.</p>
          <p>To achieve this we want to use <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">Divio</a>’s documentation system to make the docs better. It requires four different types of documentation to be created: Tutorials (learning-oriented), How-Tos (problem-oriented), Guides (understanding-oriented), Reference (information-oriented).</p>
          <p>Currently, on MDN, web security is documented on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security">Web/Security page</a> with a few subpages. We would like to bring structure into this documentation area and fill gaps.</p>

          <p>The OpenJS Foundation has a full tank of gas to build and execute a security framework roadmap for JavaScript thanks to the funding support from the <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">German government’s Sovereign Tech Fund</a>. New dedicated resources combined with active OpenJS working groups in security and standards can help the JS ecosystem broadly adopt more secure policies and practices. OpenJS is seeking feedback from web platform communities in developing a security and maintenance roadmap plan.</p>
          <p>Joe Sepi, OpenJS Cross Project Council (CPC) Chair, and Chair of the OpenJS Security Collaboration Space, together with OpenJS Executive Director Robin Ginn, seek an interactive discussion about industry best practices and priorities so that OpenJS can help customize and execute for JavaScript.</p>

              <span>by Artur Janc.</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </summary>
        <section id="cookies-desc">
          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Browser vendors' efforts to disable third-party cookies are motivated
          primarily by privacy / anti-tracking considerations, but they have a
          significant - and generally underappreciated - impact on the overall
          security of the web platform. The presence of third-party cookies is the
          root cause of multiple classes of vulnerabilities in web applications, such
          as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), clickjacking and numerous cross-site
          leaks; consequently, blocking the sending of cookies on cross-site requests
          would provide web applications with substantial isolation benefits.</p>
          <p>However, the anti-tracking focus of third-party cookie blocking efforts
          carries a risk of leading to implementations which won't reliably protect
          websites from cross-site attacks. For example, establishing the top-level
          site as the boundary for sending third-party cookies (the current
          implementation in multiple browsers) risks allowing untrusted embedded
          content, such as ads, to send credentialed requests to endpoints hosted by
          the top-level site and continue to exploit cross-site vulnerabilities.</p>
          <p>Similarly, mechanisms meant to restore functionality limited by the
          deprecation of third-party cookies, such as the
          <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-access/">Storage Access API</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/privacycg/CHIPS">Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State</a> (CHIPS),
          <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a> (FedCM),
          as well as various features to re-enable third-party cookies on a
          per-site basis, need to grapple with the same scoping rules. The risk of
          being overly permissive (for example, creating convenient mechanisms to
          fully re-enable third-party cookies for a given site) is that it will
          permit web-based attackers to bypass built-in isolation defenses. This is
          particularly concerning in the long run: if the web is safe by default from
          cross-site vulnerabilities, developers will pay less attention to
          implementing application mitigations (such as the use of CSRF tokens or
          <code>X-Frame-Options</code> headers). As a result, attackers who can regain access to
          third-party cookies on their sites will be able to exploit gaps in
          isolation on a large fraction of the web.</p>
          <p>This session is meant to discuss the cookie model that we're aiming for
          from a security perspective, including a review of the potential security
          benefits of reliable third-party cookie blocking. It also aims to identify
          specific hardening opportunities for browsers' third-party cookie blocking
          logic to help browser vendors improve their implementations.</p>

              <h4>Can securing jQuery help secure the Web forward?</h4>
              <span>by Tobie Langel.</span>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Open source security has increasingly become a top concern due to numerous high-profile and high-impact vulnerabilities affecting critical open source projects that underpin the internet's infrastructure. Over the years, various industry efforts have aimed to address this issue, with a renewed sense of urgency emerging recently. The White House and the EU Commission have taken notice, and legislative efforts are underway across multiple jurisdictions. Open source security is now increasingly framed as a software supply chain issue.</p>
          <p>In this context, the OpenSSF has launched an ambitious new project called Alpha-Omega. Most of the open source projects identified by Alpha-Omega fit well within the activity streams defined by the OpenSSF's Open Source Software Security Mobilization Plan. they are, after all, the infrastructure building blocks that this initiative was designed to harden.</p>
          <p>A few projects, however, stand out. jQuery is one of them.</p>
          <p>Originally released in 2006, jQuery has significantly impacted both web developers and browser vendors by addressing browser interoperability issues through a unified and enjoyable-to-use API. This has empowered web developers, accelerated the advent of the Web as an application platform, and driven the adoption of better Web standards and more interoperable implementations.</p>
          <p>Despite newer frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Svelte gaining popularity, jQuery remains an essential feature of the Web. As of today, it is present in a staggering 78% of the top 1 million websites, according to BuiltWith. For context, React is only found on 14% of the same sample, and most other JavaScript libraries that appeared in the meantime (e.g., Twitter Bootstrap, Modernizr, or Backbone) have fallen out of favor.</p>
          <p>jQuery's massive reach and longevity aren't its only unique aspects. It's also one of the rare JavaScript libraries identified by Alpha-Omega that is directly consumer-facing--effectively running on billions of consumer devices--and it runs inside the browser sandbox. This combination creates a different set of security concerns and calls for a dedicated approach.</p>
          <p>While this approach is specific to jQuery in this context, it touches on several broader points relevant to this audience, notably:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identifying vulnerabilities that are specific to JavaScript code that is meant to be run in the browser sandbox.</li>
            <li>Educating maintainers of web-facing open source projects about those vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Improving web developer education about browser and web application security to reduce the prevalence of those vulnerabilities that the browser sandbox cannot protect from.</li>
            <li>Supporting standardization efforts designed to reduce related risk (particularly around making it easier to manage user-generated content more safely).</li>
            <li>Exploring the life cycle of open-source projects, in particular those that fill browser standardization gaps ot interoperability issues.</li>
            <li>Examining the security aspects of hosting JavaScript on CDNs and determining best practices around those (and a possible deprecation path).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This project also provides an opportunity to explore improving the security of end-users on the web through multi-modal approaches across:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>standard bodies and standardization efforts</li>
            <li>browser implementations and developer tools</li>
            <li>developers advocates</li>
            <li>documentation (such as MDN)</li>
            <li>specialized media</li>
            <li>maintainers of open source libraries and the foundations that support them</li>
            <li>industry-wide security-focused efforts such as Alpha-Omega project</li>
            <li>open source funding through both industry and national efforts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once again--and against all odds--jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <h6>Introduction</h6>
          <p>There are many security tools that try to defend web apps in runtime in the browser by redefining and protecting built in JavaScript APIs.
          The need for such tools grows with the difficulty in securing web apps supply chains which results in having a hard time detecting changes in the supply chain that might cause harm in the victim's browser.</p>
          <p>For example, if a malicious code manages to execute within the browser of the victim, it can try accessing some secrets stored by the app in the <code>localStorage</code> - therefore we have different security tools which attempt to better control access to such sensitive APIs by redefining their behaviour to be more selective on which code is allowed to access it and which code isn't.</p>
          <h6>Problem</h6>
          <p>However, thanks to JavaScript realms, an attacker can ignore such protection quite easily by simply creating a new JavaScript realm and accessing such sensitive APIs via the new realm's unique set of APIs:</p>
          <div class="highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
            <pre><span class="pl-c">// will fail if the localStorage API is hooked into by a security tool</span>
<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">stolenSecret</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">localStorage</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">secret</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
<span class="pl-c">// bypass security tool easily - access the sensitive API via a new realm</span>
<span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">stolenSecret</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-smi">document</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">body</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">appendChild</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-smi">document</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">createElement</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s">'iframe'</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">contentWindow</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">localStorage</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">secret</span></pre>
          </div>
          <p>This effectively eliminates such protections almost completely.</p>
          <h6>Solution (WIP)</h6>
          <p>We are currently working on the most advanced solution to this problem by trying to provide an easy way to handle creation of new realms in runtime before attackers gain access to those.</p>
          <p>However, implementing such a solution in JS comes with many difficulties and issues, which could have been easier to address natively by the browser.</p>
          <h6>Goal</h6>
          <p>I wish to bring up this issue and the possible approaches to it in order to discuss and explore them.</p>

          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>Today's web frontends are more and more assembled from multiple components from different sources. Assembler tools like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> are used to bundle deliverables for the web. Even Angular and React use webpack for this purpose.
          For multiple roles, it appears important to know accurate details of this assembly and deliverables.</p>

        <section id="sbom-web-solution">
          <h5>Solution</h5>
          <p>Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a way to describe components, assembly, and formulation of software, such as web deliverables. Such SBOMs can be ingested into dependency trackers, vulnerability analyzers, or risk assessment tools.</p>
          <p>SBOM can document the state of the software they deliver to clients' web browsers. SBOM can document the licensing situation of a web frontend. SBOM can help understand supply chain risks.</p>
          <p>For all the use cases, it is very important to create an <em>accurate</em> SBOM based on what is actually delivered.</p>
          <h6>Retrieval of SBOM</h6>
          <p>Retrieving the SBOM of a web frontend is discussed in an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access">IETF draft</a>.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this is still a draft. It would really help if this was on a more mature level, a standard at best.</p>
          <h6>Generation of SBOM</h6>
          <p>One document standard for SBOM is OWASP's <a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX</a>, which is capable of documenting an application's metadata, components, dependencies, licensing, and formulation.</p>
          <p>OWASP's <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin">CycloneDX Webpack Plugin</a> is a tool that hooks into webpack to create a CycloneDX SBOM containing an aggregate of all bundled dependencies. This plugin uses the linkages generated by webpack to create a dependency graph that only contains the dependencies that are actually used (after tree-shaking) in the bundled result. To my knowledge, OWASP's CycloneDX Webpack Plugin is the only tool that creates an <em>accurate</em> SBOM based on what is actually delivered.</p>

              <h4>Applying Hardened Javascript to supply chain security for a proactive approach</h4>

        <section id="hardened-supply-chain-desc">
          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>The problem of supply chain security for the Web is currently being addressed by building up databases of known issues and improving the pace at which research and testing results are delivered to web developers. The approach has been successful in improving the security of popular open source software. The friction introduced by false-positives and its impact on security postures in the community is yet to be addressed.</p>
          <p>This approach depends on security researchers, increasingly aided by AI, discovering vulnerabilities and malicious packages. It constitutes an arms race, while the growth in malicious packages for the web ecosystem is clearly superlinear.</p>
          <p>As a result, projects wait for audit results of their dependencies to trickle down to developers, and assume malicious packages will be discovered in time for them to be stopped. Targeted attacks and sophisticated threat actors may never be stopped by this approach even at maximum throughput.</p>
          <p>We need another layer of protection that can be proactive, not reactive.</p>
          <p>Using Hardened JavaScript one can take control of all powerful APIs and resources in JavaScript and decide which should be avialable to specific dependencies. With appropriate tooling that can also include projects producing bundles where application code and dependencies coexist in one file and share references.</p>
          <p>Hardened JavaScript protects all intrinsics from being modified and introduces the <code>Compartment</code> constructor, which can be used to evaluate code in isolation from outer scope.</p>
          <p>The current approach in LavaMoat is to generate a policy at a point in time and only allow access to expected globals and imports. The enforcement happens at runtime using <code>Compartment</code>s. Any dependency suddenly turning malicious, for example by reaching for <code>fetch</code> although it was not accessing network before, will fail to work.</p>
          <p>As work on introducing Hardened Javascript (<code>Module\*</code> classes, <code>Evaluator</code>s, <code>Compartment</code> and lockdown) to JavaScript progresses, it's time to look into making runtime supply chain security a feature of the Web platform.</p>
          <p>While using <code>Compartment</code> to isolate dependencies and control what they access is a proven technique by now, open questions remain.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to DOM is the ultimate power that makes references to all globals reachable. Attempts to apply a membrane to DOM have not been successful.</li>
            <li><code>Compartment</code> can provide isolation within one Realm, but accessing another Realm would allow escalating privileges further.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I wish to present on the topic above and open a conversation about supporting the proactive approach to supply chain security in the Web platform.</p>
