  <h2>Sponsoring the Workshop</h2>
      <p>W3C is organizing a hybrid workshop to bring together security standards and best practices experts, practioners of their deployments, and developers, designers and technologists with experience adopting them. Workshop participants will collaborate to help ensure the combined movement of stronger security in the software deployment ecosystem and new security capabilities in Web standards work together to make Web apps safer.</p>

      <p>For more details on the event, see the <a href="./">workshop overview page</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring W3C Workshop “Seure the Web Forward” shows leadership and helps move the dialog forward.</p>

      <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
      <p>The cost to hold this hybrid workshop includes accessibility support (e.g. live captioning of presentations), audio video support for hybrid participation, catering (lunch and breaks), materials, travel and staffing, and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.</p>

      <p>If you see value in discussing possible improvements in the security ecosystem of the Web Platform, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the strenghtening of the Web.</p>

        <p>W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from industry, research, government, and the developer community.</p>
        <p>Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse international audience setting W3C&#39;s strategic direction, sponsorship helps your organization reach W3C&#39;s engaged participants.</p>
        <p>Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are subject to W3C approval.</p>
