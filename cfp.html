<h2>How can I participate?</h2>
 <p>Please note that this is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short, with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.</p>
<p>Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C Members.</p>

<p>If you wish to express interest in attending, please fill out the <a href="application-questions.html">expression of interest questions</a>. The application form asks several questions about your background and ideas; please give these questions serious thought. In addition to the application form, you are encouraged to <a href="#submit">submit a position statement and/or presentation topic</a>. If you cannot use the application form, please answer the application questions and email your answers to <a href="mailto:group-secure-the-web-forward-ws@w3.org">group-secure-the-web-forward-ws@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>Our aim is to get diverse attendance from a variety of industries and communities, including:
<ul>
  <li>Experts in standards and best practices needed to secure Web Applications,</li>
  <li>Practitioners of Security Supply Chain in Open Source contexts,</li>
  <li>Developer advocates with a focus on security,</li>
  <li>Developers, designers and technologists with experience in adopting and deploying Web security standards and practices.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>How can I suggest a presentation?</h2>

  <p>In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.</p>

  <p>If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by the deadline (see <a href="./#dates">important dates</a>). Our <a href="./#pc">program committee</a> will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics and perspectives.</p>

  <p>A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.</li>
    <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.</li>
    <li>Links to related supporting resources.</li>
    <li>Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be effective.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML, markdown or plain text format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked to from this workshop page.</p>

<p>Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.</p>

<p>Please submit statements to the program committee by adding your statement to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/secure-the-web-forward-workshop/tree/main/papers/">position papers directory</a> and opening a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/secure-the-web-forward-workshop/pulls">pull request</a>. Alternatively, you can email your statement to the program committee at <a href="mailto:group-secure-the-web-forward-ws@w3.org">group-secure-the-web-forward-ws@w3.org</a>.
